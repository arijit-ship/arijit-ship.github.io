The MEXT Scholarship provides various opportunities for international students to study in Japan at different levels, including undergraduate, graduate, and research programs. The scholarship covers tuition, monthly stipends, and round-trip airfare. The application process and requirements can vary depending on the specific scholarship category and the country you're applying from. 


There are six types of scholarships MEXT provides: 

 1. Research students(Graduate level),
 2. Teacher training students(Graduate level)
 3. Undergraduate students(Undergraduate level)
 4. Japanese studies students(Undergraduate level)
 5. College of technology students(Undergraduate level)
 6. Specialized training college students(Undergraduate level)

These types are relatively self-explanatory. For example, if you're pursuing a master's or Ph.D. program in Japan, you would fall under the category of Research Student. Similarly, for those interested in studying the Japanese language, they would be classified as Japanese Studies Students.

Now lets see the details for each type.
