In order to apply for the MEXT scholarship for graduate students, you must have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.30 on a 3.00 scale. This particular eligibility requirement is quite hidden. However, it is included in the guidelines distributed by MEXT to those institutions. Meeting the minimum GPA requirement is essential, as they are unable to put you forward for the scholarship unless this criterion is satisfied.

This 3-scale CGPA is rather unsual and you have to covert your grading into MEXT 3-scale CGPA.

> I'd recommend you to visit the website of the Japanese embassy in your country. They usually list the minimum CGPA requirements, and they'll likely provide the CGPA converted to your country's grading system. Just to give you an example, for India, it's around 70% for bachelor's or master's degree if you're applying as a research student.
