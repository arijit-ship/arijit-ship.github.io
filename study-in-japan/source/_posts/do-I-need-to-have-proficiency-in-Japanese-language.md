"Do I need to know Japanese for the MEXT scholarship?"

This is a question I frequently get from newcomers who are aspiring for their study in Japan. The answer isn't just a simple yes or no, so let's delve into some specifics.

It is safe to assume that if you're aiming for the MEXT scholarship, your intention goes beyond just obtaining a degree. Instead, it's likely that you're genuinely intrigued by Japanese culture and eager to immerse yourself in the experience. Cultural exchange is one of main goals of this scholarship. For that, Japanese language could be a great start.

# Do I need to know Japanese for the MEXT scholarship?

Unless you're specifically enrolling in a program focused on "Japanese studies", having a proficiency in the Japanese language isn't typically required. Based on my own experience, I can confirm that many graduate-level programs in science and engineering are conducted in English. However, its fair to expect you to have basic Japanese skills to navigate daily life in Japan. 

# Preferences will be given to the applicants with Japanese profiency

While having proficiency in the Japanese language isn't always a strict requirement, some undergraduate level courses may prioritize applicants who are skilled in Japanese. In fact, this is clearly mentiioned on the embassy website (I have checked it for India). However, if you are a research student, this is something you need to worry about the least.
