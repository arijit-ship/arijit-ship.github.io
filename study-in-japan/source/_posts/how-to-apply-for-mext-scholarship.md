## Timeframe of application

You can expect the following timeframe for the application. Keep an eye during these months of the year on the Japanese embassy website of your country.

## How to apply?

The process can differ depending on the country. Usually, you have to submit all [required documents](https://arijit-ship.github.io/study-in-japan/posts/MEXT/Documents-required/aa9ebf) to the embassy or consulate, and they will review them initially. After this review, they will announce a list of candidates who have made it to the next round. These short-listed candidates will then be required to undergo one or possibly more exams and interviews. The application procedure for MEXT is quite extensive and time-consuming. You must apply a year prior to your intended arrival in Japan. To illustrate, if you intend to begin your course in 2024, you must submit your application in 2023.

|Research students and Japanese studies students who will be studying in Japan as an exchange student based on inter-university student exchange agreements can be screened through the national, public or private Japanese university involved as a candidate for a Japanese Government Scholarship. The university directly recommends the selected candidates to the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).|
|Research students recommended by a university for study in Japan as government-sponsored scholarship recipients basically arrive in Japan in September-October.|
