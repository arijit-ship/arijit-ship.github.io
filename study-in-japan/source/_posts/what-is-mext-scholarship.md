# Introduction

MEXT stands for Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Monbukagakusho). 

The Japanese government scholarship aids international students pursuing higher education in Japan. These students are chosen through recommendations from the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General, universities, or relevant authorities. These scholarship initiatives aim to welcome outstanding individuals from overseas to Japan as international students. The goals include fostering mutual understanding with other countries, establishing human connections, enhancing the educational and research capacities of Japanese universities, and facilitating global intellectual collaboration.
