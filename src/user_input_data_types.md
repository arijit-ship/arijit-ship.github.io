## Taking user input:
<hr style="background: black">
Now will be seeing how to get an input from the user. Here we'll be using `cin >>` to assign the user input to a variable. The following code asks for your name(which is out input) and then greets you in the output.

```c++ 
#include <iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string x;
    cout << "Enter your name: \n";
    cin >> x; 
    cout << "Hello " + x + ". Nice to meet you!";
    return 0;
}
```
<br><br>
üëâWhen you run this code, it asks your name by displaying `Enter your name`. Then you type your name (say `Roy Mustang` for example) and hit the enter. Now you will see `Hello Roy Mustang! Nice to meet you.` Here you name was an input that you entered.

**A few things you may already have noticed**
<br><br>
‚úç We're including another header `<string>` in our code. That's because, your name is a string i.e. sequence of characters. Unlike some other high level languages like python; C++ is statically typed and we need to tell the compiler beforehad that hey we are  going to use string in this code.


> **‚úå**: Another thing worth mentioning is that the above code might still work even without using `#include<string>`.  The implementation of `iostream` header file indirectly adds the string to your code. But this trick does not always work(depending on what you're doing), so its better to add string explicitly.


‚úç Also from now on, we'll be dropping `std::` by adding `using namespace std` before starting `main()`.

**üöß String Concatenation**: `+` is used for appending strings one by one.

## Data type:
<hr style="background: black">
Basic data-types in C++

|Type| Description |
|--|--|
| `int` | Stores integer |
| `float` | Stores decimal numbers |
| `char` | Stores a single character |
| `string` | Stores sequence of characters |
| `bool` | Stores true or false type |
