## ðŸ¤”What is computer programming?

Computer programming(aka coding) means writing a set of instructions to your computer for solving any computation.

## ðŸ’»What is a programming language?

Language is the  _way_  we communicate with each other. A programming language is the exact same thing to communicate with your computer. Like any human language(Bengali, English etc.), a programming language also has some syntactical and grammatical rules.

In more formal definition, programming language is a set of rules to perform any kind of computation. Programming languages are  **Turing-complete**  meaning it can be used to simulate any  **Turing machine**  which can solve virtually any mathematical problem.

ðŸ‘‰If you go lowe level, your CPU dye has billions of transistors and it can understand only binary i.e a zero means _switched off_ and a one means _switched on_ conditions. With a computer programming you are bassically controlling those 'swithced on' or 'switched off' states of billions of transistors to controll the current folowing through the Si semiconductor, so that it can do some simple binary arithmatics for you. No matter how complicated computation you're doing with a computer programming, in the lowest level you're basically controlling the enormus numbers of transister switches. Now since computer can understand only binary and your code is in human-readable language like C++, Python or even Assembly language, first it needs to be converted into a stream of binary `1`'s and `0`'s.

## ðŸ“¢Some terminologies:

|#|Terms|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|1|Variable|Container to store data.|
|2|Character|Unit of in information equivalent to one alphabatic letter or symbol.|
|3|String|Sequence of characters.|
|4|Compiler|A translator for converting human readable language to machine language. It converts the entire source code in a single run.|
|5|Interpreter|A translator which translates each line of your code at a time.|
