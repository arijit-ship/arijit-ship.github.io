## ðŸ¤”What is computer programming?

Computer programming(aka coding) means writing a set of instructions on your computer for solving any computation. We provide these instructions through some human readable language known as _programming languages_. A programming must be **Turing Complete**, meaning you can solve any mathematical problem with it(no matter how much time it takes!!).
