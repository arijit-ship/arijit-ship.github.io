**C++ is a statically-typed compiled programming language.** It was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup. He was inspired by the object-oriented nature of Simula and but needed a language with high performance like C. And thats how C++, a language basically C with classes, was born. C++ is a superset of C, so virtually any C program is also a valid program in C++.

> C++ or C-plus-plus or Cpp is an extremely popular object-oriented programming language. Created in 1979, today it powers game engines, databases, compilers, embedded systems, desktop software, and much of our software infrastructure.
