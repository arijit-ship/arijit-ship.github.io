# Introduction(... kinda awkward!!)
Before getting started, I must tell you guys that, this is not any kind of C++ tutorial, per se; neither I'm any expert C++ programmer. This is a well-arranged notes(C++ Ninja Notes) that I'm making while teaching myself C++. Any kind of correction is welcomedðŸ˜„

Also, I'm assuming you have some basic knowledge on computer programming like what is a text editor, what is a compiler and an interpreter, how to get one installed on your machine and now you're ready to write some high quality codeðŸ˜Ž  
  
Having a bit of knowledge in any programming language will be surely nice, since  _syntax does not matter, problem solving patterns matter most!_

_âœ” Also I'd not recommend any book since I really don't read any book for programming. If you're one of those kind who can't get along without a book, please feel free to keep one with you. Our approach of learning new languages should be more pragmatic. In real world software development, you often work with multiple languages and constantly learning new things and improving your problem solving pattern. Programming is not about memorizing syntaxes, its totally okay forget them!!_
