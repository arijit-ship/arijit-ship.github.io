>A random number is a number chosen as if by chance from some specified distribution such that selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces the underlying distribution. Almost always, such numbers are also required to be independent, so that there are no correlations between successive numbers.

So here’s the long story short: Random numbers are just unpredictable numbers and you can not correlate two successive random numbers.

- **How does a computer generate a random number when you write a program to generate one?**
<br><br>
Computers can generate truly random numbers by observing some outside data, like mouse movements or fan noise, which is not predictable, and creating data from it. This is known as entropy. Other times, they generate “pseudorandom” numbers by using an algorithm so the results appear random, even though they aren’t. 

- **How much random they are?**
<br><br>
As said above, they can be almost random depending upon how they are being generated. However, "pseudorandom" numbers are made possible by the algorithm. These pseudorandom numbers are not truly random numbers, and as they are generated by an algorithm, they can be predicted.

>A pseudorandom number generator, also known as a deterministic random bit generator, is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers.

**Pseudorandom numbers are useful for experiments and simulations, however, they’re not used for security purposes.**

## Random numbers in C++
<hr style="height:1px; background: black; border: none;">

`int rand(void)` returns a random(pseudo-random) integer between 0 to `RAND_MAX`. This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers each time it is called. This algorithm uses a seed to generate the series, which should be initialized to some distinctive value using function `srand`. 
`RAND_MAX` is a constant defined in `<cstdlib>`.

**📢Generate a random number between the range of two floating numbers**
<b>

```c++
float getRandom(float a, float b){

    //A random no between 0 to 1
    float random_no = rand()/float(RAND_MAX);

    //A random no between a to b
    random_no= a + (b-a)*random_no;
    return random_no;
}
```
